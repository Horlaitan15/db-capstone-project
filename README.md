## Order of running...

There are three SQL scripts here, after the database has been created either through the Forward Engineering process or using the `LittleLemonDB.sql`, the `insert_commands.sql` should be ran. This command insert data into important tables like Bookings, Customers, Addresses, and Countries.

The `procedure_implementation.sql` file contains the stored procedures and the statement that are to be created.
